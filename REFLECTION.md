# Reflection - IP Address Tracker Project
## Author: Dewan Mahmud (Rocky)
## Per Scholas - Software Engineering

1. What I learned

# During this project I gained a stronger understanding of:
-	Connecting JavaScript to an external API
-	How IP addresses can be converted into location data
-	How to read API documentation and build requests correctly
-	Using async and await to handle asynchronous network calls
-	Updating the UI dynamically based on API responses
-	How LeafletJS renders a world map and updates markers
-	How CSS, HTML, and JavaScript work together as one system

## This project helped me improve my debugging skills, API usage, and map integration.

2. Challenges I faced
# Some challenges I experienced while building this project:
-	First time working with geolocation API responses
-	Handling invalid IP address errors and displaying messages
-	Getting Leaflet map to update correctly when new IPs were searched
-	Organizing files into clean structure (HTML, CSS, JS separated)
-	Understanding how to update DOM elements from API results

## At first, errors were confusing, but step by step testing helped me solve them.

3. What I improved over time
-	UI structure became more organized and readable
-	CSS classes were renamed for consistency
-	Search input validation improved to prevent empty requests
-	Map marker now updates correctly instead of stacking
-	Code comments added for future readability and maintenance

## Each improvement made the project more stable and more professional.

4. What I would like to add in the future
-	Dark / light mode toggle
-	Lookup history (previous IP searches saved)
-	Speed test / ping test feature
-	Reverse lookup (City - show all IP ranges)
-	Security features or warnings for unsafe domains

## The goal is to expand this tool into a complete Internet safety dashboard.

5. Personal Reflection

# This project gave me real confidence.
- I built something practical, visual, and useful.
- I learned how to research problems instead of giving up.
- Step by step, I am improving as a developer through effort and repetition.
- I am proud of this progress and excited to continue building more advanced projects.
